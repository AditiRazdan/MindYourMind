      <th> Sleep </th>
    </div>

    <div class="information">
      <th> Sleep is essential for all people because it allows the brain and body to recharge and remain healthy. It is especially important for teens to support their developing brain and physical growth. Lack of sleep can also cause feelings of demotivation, weaken performance in extracurriculars, and impact your outcomes in school. Still, most teens do not get the ideal amount of sleep, averaging around 6.5-7.5 hours when they should be getting 8-10. </th>

      <th> Food </th>
    </div>

    <div class="information">
      <th>  Food really is fuel for the body. Eating enough and having a balanced diet are needed to remain healthy both mentally and physically. Without nutritious food, you may feel more tired and demotivated throughout your day. Eating enough fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and calcium can help you prevent these feelings. </th>

    <div class="causes">
      <th> Hydration </th>
    </div>

    <div class="information">
      <th> Dehydration can influence the quality of your sleep, which is beneficial for muscle and tissue growth and recovery. Being dehydrated can also give you symptoms of exhaustion that may influence your happiness and performance in academics and hobbies. To be healthy, it is recommended that teens drink about 64-88 ounces of water per day. Other factors such as weather, health conditions, and daily activities should also be considered when drinking water as they can make you more prone to dehydration. </th>
