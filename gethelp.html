      <th> It's Normal to Feel Sad </th>
    </div>

    <div class="information">
      <th> Emotions are normal and a part of human nature. Feeling sad may be uncomfortable, but it is an essential emotion that can benefit you. While it is a challenging process, understanding and processing your emotions can allow you to move on and maintain a balanced life. Avoiding your emotions can take a toll on your emotional health and lead you to lose your authenticity. Strategies such as journaling, exercising, or listening to music can help alleviate feelings of sadness. However, if you consistently experience symptoms of sadness for extended periods or feel that this emotion is preventing you from your daily functions, it may be a sign of a mental health condition. If you are experiencing these feelings or need assistance processing your emotions, you can reach out to your PAC through this website and simply book an appointment with them. If you are concerned about yourself or someone you know who is experiencing prolonged sadness, you can anonymously inform the school using the peer reporting form. If you notice signs of bullying or harassment, it is crucial that you use this form to preserve mental health and positivity in our school as well. </th>
